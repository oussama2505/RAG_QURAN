# Quran RAG Migration: Streamlit to Svelte

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to migrate the existing RAG-Quran application from Streamlit to Svelte while maintaining all current functionality and improving the user experience.

## Current System Analysis
### Features
- Query interface for Quran exploration
- API integration with OpenAI
- Source displaying (Quran verses and Tafsir)
- Filtering by Surah
- Response generation with citations
- API key management
- Progress indicators and status updates

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: Vector storage (FAISS)
- AI: OpenAI integration
- Data: JSON files for Quran and Tafsir

## Migration Planning

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Architecture

- [ ] Add caching layer
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Add animations and transitions

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
#### Thought Process
1. Develop testing strategy
2. Plan deployment pipeline
3. Set up monitoring
4. Create backup procedures

#### Action Items
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Prepare production deployment

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1: Project Setup
2. Create initial Svelte project structure
3. Set up development environment
4. Start component planning

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Architecture
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Components Development
