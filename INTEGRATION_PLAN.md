# RAG Quran: A2A & MCP Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to integrate Google A2A (Agents-to-Agents) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) into the RAG Quran project. The goal is to enable agent-to-agent communication, standardized tool access, and extensibility for future features.

---

## To-Do List

### 1. Preparation

- [x] Review the A2A repository and documentation
- [x] Review the MCP documentation and example servers/clients
- [x] Identify existing agents/components in the RAG Quran backend (retriever, generator, etc.)

### 2. Set Up A2A Framework

- [x] Install A2A dependencies in the backend Python environment
- [x] Create a base agent interface/class using A2A
- [x] Refactor retriever and generator as A2A agents
- [x] Add a tool agent (e.g., tafsir lookup, translation)
- [x] Implement agent-to-agent communication (e.g., retriever → generator → tool)

### 3. Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- [x] Choose MCP Python SDK or implement protocol endpoints manually
- [x] Wrap each agent as an MCP server (retriever, generator, tool)
- [x] Expose agent APIs and tool access via MCP
- [x] Test MCP endpoints locally (using MCP Inspector or compatible client)

### 4. Add and Test More Agents/Tools

- [x] Add additional agents (e.g., summarizer, external API connector)
- [x] Add more tools (e.g., database access, file system, translation)
- [x] Test agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication using A2A and MCP

### 5. Demonstration & Documentation

- [x] Create test scripts or endpoints to demonstrate agent workflows
- [x] Document agent APIs and tool usage
- [x] Add usage examples for agent communication and tool access
- [x] Update project README with integration details

### 6. (Optional) UI/CLI Integration

- [ ] Add a simple UI or CLI to trigger agent workflows and display results
- [ ] Document how to use the new features from the frontend

## Notes

- Refer to the A2A and MCP documentation for best practices and advanced features.
- Use the MCP Inspector and A2A demo scripts for debugging and validation.
- This plan is iterative; feel free to expand with more agents, tools, or workflows as needed.
