# UI/CLI Integration Plan for RAG Quran

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to implement a user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI) for the RAG Quran project, integrating with the existing frontend and leveraging the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) infrastructure we've already built.

## Frontend UI Integration

### 1. Component Structure

- [x] Create a new Svelte component for the advanced search interface
- [x] Create a component for displaying search results with source attribution
- [x] Add a settings panel component for API configuration and model selection
- [x] Design a component for displaying translation and summarization options

### 2. API Integration

- [x] Create TypeScript service modules to communicate with MCP servers
- [x] Implement API client for the Retriever MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Generator MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Translation MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Summarizer MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Tafsir MCP server

### 3. User Interface Features

- [x] Implement an advanced search form with filters for surahs and verses
- [x] Add translation selector with available translations
- [x] Create a summarization control panel with length and focus options
- [x] Implement source display with highlighted references
- [x] Add tooltips for Quranic terms and concepts

### 4. State Management

- [x] Create stores for managing search state
- [x] Create stores for managing user preferences and settings
- [x] Implement caching for previously fetched results

## CLI Integration

### 1. Command-Line Tool Setup

- [x] Create a new Python module for CLI functionality
- [x] Set up argument parsing with argparse
- [x] Implement help text and documentation
- [x] Design a clear output format

### 2. Commands Implementation

- [x] Implement search command with query and filter options
- [x] Implement translation command for verse retrieval
- [x] Implement summarize command for tafsir content
- [x] Implement tafsir lookup command
- [x] Add configuration command for API settings

### 3. Output Formatting

- [x] Create colored and formatted CLI output
- [x] Implement JSON output option
- [x] Add markdown output for documentation generation
- [x] Include progress indicators for long-running operations

### 4. Installation and Packaging

- [x] Create setup.py for CLI tool installation
- [x] Add entry point for direct command execution
- [x] Document installation process in README

## Testing

- [x] Create unit tests for UI components
- [x] Create integration tests for API communication
- [x] Test CLI commands with various options
- [x] Perform user testing of the complete interface

## Documentation

- [x] Update main README with UI usage instructions
- [x] Add CLI documentation with examples
- [x] Create screenshots for the UI documentation
- [x] Add troubleshooting section

## Deployment

- [x] Update Docker configuration to include UI and CLI tools
- [x] Create build scripts for production deployment
- [x] Document deployment process

---

This plan focuses on integrating both a graphical user interface (using the existing Svelte frontend) and a command-line interface with our implemented agents and MCP servers. The UI will provide a user-friendly way to access the advanced features, while the CLI will enable scriptable access and integration with other tools.
