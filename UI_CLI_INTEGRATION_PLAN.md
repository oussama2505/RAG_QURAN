# UI/CLI Integration Plan for RAG Quran

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to implement a user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI) for the RAG Quran project, integrating with the existing frontend and leveraging the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) infrastructure we've already built.

## Frontend UI Integration

### 1. Component Structure

- [x] Create a new Svelte component for the advanced search interface
- [x] Create a component for displaying search results with source attribution
- [x] Add a settings panel component for API configuration and model selection
- [x] Design a component for displaying translation and summarization options

### 2. API Integration

- [x] Create TypeScript service modules to communicate with MCP servers
- [x] Implement API client for the Retriever MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Generator MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Translation MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Summarizer MCP server
- [x] Implement API client for the Tafsir MCP server

### 3. User Interface Features

- [x] Implement an advanced search form with filters for surahs and verses
- [x] Add translation selector with available translations
- [x] Create a summarization control panel with length and focus options
- [x] Implement source display with highlighted references
- [x] Add tooltips for Quranic terms and concepts

### 4. State Management

- [x] Create stores for managing search state
- [x] Create stores for managing user preferences and settings
- [ ] Implement caching for previously fetched results

## CLI Integration

### 1. Command-Line Tool Setup

- [ ] Create a new Python module for CLI functionality
- [ ] Set up argument parsing with argparse
- [ ] Implement help text and documentation
- [ ] Design a clear output format

### 2. Commands Implementation

- [ ] Implement search command with query and filter options
- [ ] Implement translation command for verse retrieval
- [ ] Implement summarize command for tafsir content
- [ ] Implement tafsir lookup command
- [ ] Add configuration command for API settings

### 3. Output Formatting

- [ ] Create colored and formatted CLI output
- [ ] Implement JSON output option
- [ ] Add markdown output for documentation generation
- [ ] Include progress indicators for long-running operations

### 4. Installation and Packaging

- [ ] Create setup.py for CLI tool installation
- [ ] Add entry point for direct command execution
- [ ] Document installation process in README

## Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for UI components
- [ ] Create integration tests for API communication
- [ ] Test CLI commands with various options
- [ ] Perform user testing of the complete interface

## Documentation

- [ ] Update main README with UI usage instructions
- [ ] Add CLI documentation with examples
- [ ] Create screenshots for the UI documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section

## Deployment

- [ ] Update Docker configuration to include UI and CLI tools
- [ ] Create build scripts for production deployment
- [ ] Document deployment process

---

This plan focuses on integrating both a graphical user interface (using the existing Svelte frontend) and a command-line interface with our implemented agents and MCP servers. The UI will provide a user-friendly way to access the advanced features, while the CLI will enable scriptable access and integration with other tools.
